//Composition in Kotlin is a design principle where a class is constructed by combining references to other objects (components) rather than inheriting from them. Instead of building an "is-a" relationship (like inheritance), it creates a "has-a" relationshipâ€”where one class has or uses another class to achieve functionality. This approach promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability by allowing you to swap or modify behaviors at runtime without being tied to a rigid class hierarchy. By delegating specific tasks to composed objects, each class remains focused on a single responsibility, making the code easier to test, debug, and extend. Essentially, composition helps you build complex systems from simple, interchangeable parts while avoiding the pitfalls of tight coupling and fragile base classes common in deep inheritance trees.
